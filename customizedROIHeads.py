    In Detectron, proposals for training keypoint head are re-sampled from
    all the proposals with IOU>threshold & >=1 visible keypoint.

    Here, the proposals are first sampled from all proposals with
    IOU>threshold, then proposals with no visible keypoint are filtered out.
    This strategy seems to make no difference on Detectron and is easier to implement.
